This is a simple Rust script that generates all possible subarrays for a given array of integers.

There are two approaches. One uses a simple loop, the other one a recursive loop. Both have a bad runtime complexity of O(n³). 

Sample performance for an array of size 10:
Elapsed time (loop): 15.427µs
Elapsed time (recursive): 17.801µs
